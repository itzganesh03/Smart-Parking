        <h2>SMARTPARKING MOBILE APPLICATION PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
        <h3>
Smart Parking Limited takes seriously the need to protect the privacy of users of its SmartParking Web application (WebApp).

This Privacy Policy describes how Smart Parking Limited together with its affiliates (collectively we, our or us in this Privacy Policy) may collect, use, disclose, and hold information about an identifiable individual (Personal Information) as well as other business or technical data, in the course of operating the App and providing parking, payment and other services to users via the App.

This Privacy Policy also describes the purposes for which we may use, disclose or hold such Personal Information and other data.

What we collect

We may collect information during the course of your relationship with us, or during your use of our App. This includes the following:

We may collect location data from the device you are using to access the App, in order to enable us to provide parking and other services via the App. This may require you to enable or authorise location services via the permission system used by your mobile operating system. If you do not enable or authorise location services, the App may not be able to provide you with all of its features or services.

When you establish a user account or user profile with us we may collect personal details from you. This may include some or all of the following: your name, a user name, password and an email address.

When you use the App to pay for parking, we may collect transaction details from you. This may include the location of your park, the time and date, your vehicle number plate, and user details. You will also need to input payment details. See below for details of how credit card and payment information is processed.

Information about you or the vehicle you are parking may also be collected electronically at the parking location, either by our systems or by a third-party vehicle parking provider.

We may collect other Personal Information and data during the course or as a result of your relationship with us, including (without limitation) where necessary to enable us to provide products and services to you or to respond to requests for further information.

Credit card and payment information

All payments for vehicle parking via the App are facilitated through a third-party payment processing service provider. We currently use Braintree, a subsidiary of PayPal, Inc., but we may replace our third-party payment processing service provider without notice to you. The third-party payment processing service provider will capture and store transaction details (i.e. vehicle number plate and credit card details) to enable the payment to be processed and the parking fee to be charged to the correct vehicle.

We do not hold or store any user’s credit card information.

What we do with your data

We will use, disclose and hold Personal Information and data collected by us via the App in order to operate the App and to provide parking services via the App. This includes completing and processing sales transactions with App users and carpark providers, establishing and maintaining user records, providing technical support and administration services in relation to the App, and product development or research or evaluation.

We may also disclose and hold Personal Information and data collected by us via the App to the extent necessary to respond to your queries or requests for information or assistance, to provide after-sales service, or to keep you informed about products, services, events, promotions or any other marketing activities, but only to the extent permissible under applicable laws, and subject to any other restrictions contained in this Privacy Policy.

We may provide your Personal Information and other data to service providers and other third parties, but only to the extent reasonably necessary to achieve the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, or where we reasonably believe that such use or disclosure is required or expressly permitted under any applicable law.

Holding Personal Information

We will not hold your Personal Information for longer than is reasonably required for the purposes for which we may lawfully use that Personal Information.

Statistical data that we collect

We may collect statistical data about your use of the App. This may include the date, time and length of your use or the pages or features of the App that you visit or use. We may also collect information about the device you are using to access the App. This information may be collected by software operating on our App, or by third party service providers on our behalf.

We may use and disclose such statistical data to maintain and optimise the technical performance, operation and security of the App, to identify user behaviour and user trends on the App, to measure the effectiveness of any services or features provided via the App, and to assist in resource planning.

We may disclose or sell such statistical data to others for any purpose, but only on an aggregated basis and in a way that ensures that no individual is able to be identified from such data.

We may also use, sell or disclose any of the data about users of the App that we collect for any purpose other than those purposes expressly permitted under this Privacy Policy, but only on an aggregated basis and in a way that ensures that no individual is able to be identified from such data.

Cookies

Our App may use cookies. “Cookies” are small text files that are placed on computers, devices or browsers used to access websites, apps or other internet content. We may use cookies to remember information about your personal preferences and user settings for the App, to analyse App traffic and trends, and to generally understand the behaviours and interests of people who use the App.

Our cookies will only use information about your personal preferences and user settings so that our App will remember your details next time you visit. We may use, disclose or sell other data collected by us from cookies for other purposes, but only on an aggregated basis and in a way that ensures that no individual is able to be identified from such information.

You may be able to change the settings on the device that you use to access the App in order to reject or limit the use of cookies, but this may reduce the functionality of the App.

Marketing

We may use Personal Information collected by us or via the App to send or email to you marketing or promotional information about our services or products, or the services or products of other companies (Direct Marketing Information), but only if you have expressly given us permission to do so.

If you have given us permission to send to you Direct Marketing Information, and you later decide that you do not want us to send you any further Direct Marketing Information, you can contact us at any time to request that we stop sending you such information. You can either contact our Privacy Officer (see the details at the end of this Privacy Policy) or use the “Unsubscribe” facility at the bottom of any Direct Marketing Information email or communication that we send you.

We will not sell your Personal Information to direct marketers unless you have expressly given us permission to do so.

Use of third-party websites

If you access any third-party websites via a link from the App, you will leave the App. By accessing these links you are not covered by the policies relating to the App. We are not responsible for the content of any third-party websites, or their use of your Personal Information.

Business acquisition

We may transfer your Personal Information to another entity in connection with a sale of our business or assets, a merger or consolidation or restructuring of our business or company, or any other transaction in which a third party acquires ownership of any rights in the App.

Transfer of Information

We may transfer the information described in this Privacy Policy to or from other countries to the extent necessary to enable us to operate the App and to provide services via the App. Some of these countries may have less protective privacy or data protection laws than the region in which you reside. Where this is the case, we will take appropriate measures to protect your Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

Security

We will use all reasonable endeavours to effect and maintain adequate security measures to safeguard the Personal Information we hold from loss or unauthorised access, use, modification or disclosure. However, as the internet is an open network, we do not warrant or guarantee that your Personal Information is safe from loss or unauthorised access, use, modification or disclosure, either during transmission to or from the App, or when held by us.

Your rights to access and correct Personal Information

Where we hold Personal Information about you, you have a right to access and correct that Personal Information in accordance with applicable laws. If you want to access or correct your Personal Information, please contact our Privacy Officer (see below) and he/she will tell you how to make a request and if any charges will apply.

Amendments to the Privacy Policy

We may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. Notice of any such amendments will be announced on the App or to App users via email or other means. Any such amendments will be effective immediately, unless we state otherwise. Your continued use of the App after any such notice will constitute your acceptance of any amendments or revisions to this Privacy Policy.

You should periodically review this Privacy Policy for the latest information about our privacy practices.
